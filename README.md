# capstone-portfolio


A website portfolio designed to showcase my designs and knowledge - all of which is
part of my progress learning to become a Front End Web Developer.

This portfolio is based around a single page - using svg animations and modal windows to
both demonstrate my progress, and provide interesting interactivity.

The project focuses upon Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 techniques - an example of
each area of these tools is available somewhere in the code! Links on each modal project
detail give access to GitHib Repos and live pages.

Primarily, the finished product is focussing on responsiveness and accessibility
-- and to show off ;)

As a consequence of loading everything up front, the page could be relatively
slow to initialize on poor connections, and relies upon the latest technologies
being available in the user's browser.

Possible improvements: add a landing page giving options for 'smart and quick'
or 'stupid and slow' - but for the moment, that is not the objective!!
